<h3>Cindy</h3>
<br>
<p>Cindy I love you and I love this plan. I am nothing but a raw hunk of clay in your hands, and I'm thrilled that you love me. I've made a lot of mistakes. You are definitely not one of them. Sorry I ruined the Monaco GP! I didn't think that you might want to watch it. It won't happen again. I love you. </p>
<p>I'm going to learn React.JS and how to build a project with a Spring Boot backend and React front-end it should be very awesome and highly marketable. I made it to Missouri!</p>
